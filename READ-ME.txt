How often do you read the news lately and don't see the panorama tag, although it should be... 
It becomes a big problem for me... 
Fortunately I am learning data science and I have all tools for split news to classes.

In first part of my project I have uploaded 4k posts from ia_panorama and 4k from rt_russia.
1. Prepeared data (clean from data leak and etc.) in 'make_data.ipynb' 
2. Make neural network based on bert layer, pretrained on russian texts 'NN.ipynb'
3. Improve this using XGBoost and meta features 'xgb.ipunb'
4. Clustering comments under these news.
